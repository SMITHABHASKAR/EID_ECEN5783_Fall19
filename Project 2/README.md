Project 2- WebClient to display the latest Temperature and Humidity values
We have integrated the results from Project 1 to be displayed on the web application which is enabled by 2 websockets , one for a tornado server and other for a node.js server. 

Objective:
When the IP and port of the server and client are entered on the web application, upon successful connection it should display the buttons. The buttons are :
-->To show the latest temp and humidity data
-->To to display the current status based on sensor readings
-->To convert the data from degree Celsius to Farenheit 
-->To test the network responsiveness
